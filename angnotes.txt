JIT - Compile TypeScript just in time for executing it.

Compiled in the browser.
Each file compiled separately.
No need to build after changing your code and before reloading the browser page.
Suitable for local development.
AOT - Compile TypeScript during build phase.

Compiled by the machine itself, via the command line (Faster).
All code compiled together, inlining HTML/CSS in the scripts.
No need to deploy the compiler (Half of Angular size).
More secure, original source not disclosed.
Suitable for production builds.

Run angular projects on local
First verify your machine IP Address.

On Windows, type ipconfig in Prompt (copy IPv4).
On Mac, type ifconfig |grep inet in Terminal (copy inet).

In my case this is 192.168.0.10.

Next, type ng serve --host 192.168.0.10.

Ok, your app on air for all devices on same network.

Now only http://192.168.0.10:4200/ will work, localhost not more.
